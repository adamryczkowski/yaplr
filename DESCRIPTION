Description: Merges functionality of svSocket and parallel with synchronicity packages and gives convenient API
    for spawning new threads by either forking or planting them on remote machine via svSocket.
    Calcluations spawned via svSocket can be easily debugged (even executed step-by-step) if remote svSocket is
    ran on RStudio.
